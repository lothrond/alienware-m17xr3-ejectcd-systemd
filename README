================================

Fix the ejectcd button on Alienware M17xR3 laptops using systemd.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This is a patch that will get you commit cfd54b6 of systemd.

At the time of this writing, this commit is only in the master branch.
Also, the latest systemd release is v244.

This patch can be applied to 60-keyboard.hwdb (i.e. /lib/udev/hwdb.d/60-keyboad.hwdb)
by issuing something like: 
    
	sudo patch 60-keyboard.hwdb /path/to/60-keyboard.hwdb.alienware-M17xR3.patch

After applying the patch, dont forget to update your hwdb.bin by issuing something like:

    sudo systemd-hwdb update
    sudo udevadm trigger /dev/input/event4

(Check with your distribution for information on reloading this database, as these commmands may be different).

Now, to see if the patch applied correctly, one can issue something like:

	sudo udevadm test /sys/class/input/event4 | grep KEYBOARD_KEY_89

Or press the button. :)
